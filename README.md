Responsive Resume
=================

It's a resume. It's responsive. It's awesome and always in progress

I read [A Case for Responsive Résumés](http://alistapart.com/article/a-case-for-responsive-resumes) in 2012. I had multiple copies of my resume, and I was always having trouble keeping them appropriately up-top-date and finding the *one* version that I needed. A responsive resume seemed like the perfect way, going forward, to keep one synced document that can be viewed anywhere. After seeing another developer who had also mixed in microformats, I figured this was a great opportunity to use those to provide a consistent structure to the whole thing. I also followed along with David Bushell's [Implementing Off-Canvas Navigation For A Responsive Website](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2013/01/15/off-canvas-navigation-for-responsive-website/) to help with space management at smaller screen sizes.

Updates
-------
- Added latest job and skill information

Future Plans
------------
-  I tried to keep requests down, but I could probably make things more performant and squeeze things down even further.
-  Run this through more IE VMs than I have access to at home.
-  Convert data to JSON
-  Build the displayed resume with a modern JS framework, like Angular2
