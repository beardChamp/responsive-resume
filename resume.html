							<p>I'm leading one of three front-end teams (4-5 developers each) to improve the experience for 4+ million customers a month on the Ally Auto website built in Ember JS. So far, we've integrated a Title Tracker to provide customers with status updates on their end-of-loan title process. We've added marketing tiles to make customers aware of additional Ally products and services. We've also been working to provide customers with more assistance options during the COVID-19 crisis, including up to 120 days of payment deferment and online access to additional hardship programs.</p>

							<p>I've worked to build an enterprise-grade document-managment system from the ground up in Angular(4+) with a .NET backend, utilizing Redux-style state management with ngrx/store. I balso uilt the interface for the One-Click AUS feature, displaying extracted data from the Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac automatic underwriting systems reports in a convenient comparison view that cut nearly two days off of the company's average mortgage turn times.</p>

							<p>I'm working to bring best practices to Healthicity's products by building a centralized, JavaScript platform for maximum reuse of components. To support this, I'm collaborating with design to convert and extend our design system.

							<p>I worked to help revamp the look and feel of AdvancedMDs practice management and electronic health records applications. I built proofs of concept in AngularJS to ascertain viability of UX ideas, including the advanced scheduler calendar. I also managed centralized design resources like common SCSS/CSS libraries, images, and icons used across the organization. Also, I worked to train and mentor a second UX Developer in company and development best practices.</p>

							</h4>
							<p>Partnering with the UX team, I helped build out a custom backbone.js app to create a modular, responsive framework for projects to flesh out ideas like our Visual Design Language and the first round of ideas that became ADP's enterprise flagship product, Redbox. That required building data visualizations with D3.js, including integrating a solution for custom SVG label sizing and concatenation into the production Redbox application. I also worked with Node.js to produce a lightweight JSON API endpoint for other data visualization projects. I worked with Grunt and Gulp to improve and automate build processes. Our team has also explored hybrid mobile apps and microservices using the Meteor JS framework. I also acted as a resource for more junior team members to improve their front end skills.</p>

							<p>Focusing mostly on Javascript programming using the YUI Application Framework, I added interaction and on-demand content loading across the four client facing applications (web for fans, mobile web for fans, client manager, and system admin). This includes major rewrites of the manager, admin, and web fan apps where I added new editorial content types in admin, created mobile content previews through a web-based recreation of our iOS fan app. Additionally, I modified our web fan app to be fully responsive, allowing better continuity with our email marketing initiatives and the removal of our previous mobile web project.</p>

							<p>As lead developer on the Community Connect social networking platform, I incorporated the latest best practices and improved the user experience. We converted a number of user flows to AJAX, so that multi-step processes became single-page or even single-element specific. We updated our analytics section to better show administrators the data that was truly useful to them.</p>
							<p>While at SelectMinds, I was also the lead front-end developer on our mobile web initiative. The Community Connect product was already a hosted, web application. It made perfect sense, with this core knowledge and the importance of email marketing to our customers, to create a mobile web app leveraging jQuery Mobile. This let us make an app that catered to iPhone and Android users (Google was a client, so Android support was paramount) while maintaining access for more recent Blackberries and similarly capable phone browsers.</p>
